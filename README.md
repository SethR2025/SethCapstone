# Home Health Care Services in The United States

This project will attempt to answer the following question: which states in the US provide the best home health care service based on patient surveys? I drilled down on top states, and providers, as well as bottom states and providers. I felt this topic would be relevant to my future employment given my drive toward the healthcare industry, which is systematically moving toward home health services.

## Motivation

I am pulled toward the Healthcare industry because my mom and both of my sisters are nurses, and I have gotten to see how important Healthcare is right here in Nashville. Once I discovered the Medicare data  in my research, I knew that analyzing it to tier home health agencies nation-wide would bring together my passion for healthcare and expertise in data-science.

## Data Question

My project, based on analysis of substantial data sets, shows which Home Health Care agencies provide the best and worst services by state and provider, based on a variety of metrics. I would also like to explore the relationship between median household income and the outcomes of the surveys. Finally, I analyzed the relationship between provider location and patient review scores.

## Analysis

First, I began with creating the Total Score for every state and every provider. Scores were created using each category in the dataset, determining if it is a positive or negative, and then totaling the numbers to give a final score ranging from 650 to 1300 (1300 being the best). Every category was calculated as a percentage so for every positive category I would add the percentage and for every negative category I would subtract the percentage. I used this score to rank every provider and every state from best to worst, and then I plotted the information on a Tableau map. I will also be creating multiple bar charts to visualize the states and providers, that will be available in the PowerPoint presentation.
