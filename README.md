# Home Health Care Services in The United States

This project will attempt to answer the following question, which states in the US provide the best home health care service? I will then drill down on top states, and providers, as well as bottom states and providers. I am motivated to do this because I feel that it could be beneficial to my future employer and healthcare is a very hot subject in Nashville and The United States as a whole.
# Motivation
I was pulled toward the Healthcare industry because my mom used to be a nurse and both my older sisters are nurses currently, and I have gotten to see how important Healthcare is right here in Nashville. I discovered the medicare data website while I was looking for healthcare datasets and I found some very compelling data that I decided to analyze.
# Data Question
My overall question is who provides the best and worst Home Health Care services by State and Provider. I want to answer the question of what are the top providers doing correctly and what do the bottom providers need to improve on.
