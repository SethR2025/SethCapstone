# Home Health Care Services in The United States

This project will attempt to answer the following question, which states in the US provide the best home health care service based on patient surveys? I will then drill down on top states, and providers, as well as bottom states and providers. I am motivated to do this because I feel that it could be beneficial to my future employer and healthcare is a very hot subject in Nashville and The United States as a whole.
# Motivation
I was pulled toward the Healthcare industry because my mom used to be a nurse and both my older sisters are nurses currently, and I have gotten to see how important Healthcare is right here in Nashville. I discovered the medicare data website while I was looking for healthcare datasets and I found some very compelling data that I decided to analyze.
# Data Question
My overall question is who provides the best and worst Home Health Care services by State and Provider. I want to answer the question of what are the top providers doing correctly and what do the bottom providers need to improve on. I would also like to find out if there is a correlation between median household income and the outcomes of the surveys.
